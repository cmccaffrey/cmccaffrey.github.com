<h1>Cheryl's Web 2 Homework</h1>
<h2>Week 1</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Park, beach: Arnold Arboreteum or Misquamicut Beach, RI. 
		The Arnold Arboreteum because I love walking and running there in the 
		summer. Also it is a close location in case I need photos for the site.
		Misquamicut Beach is a beach I have gone to since I was a child so has 
		significance for me. Both sites need updating - especially Misquamicut Beach.
		</li>	
		<li>Local small business: Voltage coffee shop. This is a coffee shop near
		work; also host artist's work. The site is very simple, heavy on content,
		focusing on blog posts. I think the site could look more like a place
		to go rather than a blog.</li>
		<li>Lobbying group: Stephen Colbert for President. I thought this would
		be a fun parody site since he tried to get on the ballot for the 
		South Carolina primary. Other (serious) ideas are the Environmental
		Working Group, which is a non-profit dedicated to improving public
		health and protecting the environment. Or the National Coalition 
		Against Domestic Violence.</li>
